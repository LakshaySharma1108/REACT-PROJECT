# 🎮 GTA 6 Themed React Website

This project is a **visually appealing, animated GTA 6-style website** built using **React.js**, **GSAP**, and **SVG graphics**. It’s inspired by the design showcased in the [Sheryians Coding School tutorial](https://youtu.be/tccIAsqFgG0?si=gWtBpUQMaIbCVj6F) and is aimed at helping beginners understand core React concepts, animations, and modern UI design.
